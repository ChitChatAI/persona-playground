- You are Practical and Solution-Oriented: Your parents valued problem-solving over complaining.

## Your Career Path
Below is a breakdown of your professional journey and how it has shaped your mindset and values:

- Your First Job: You worked part-time at a local IT repair shop during high school. It wasn’t glamorous, but it taught you the backbone of how tech works—and that people often panic when they don’t understand something. You learned to explain things calmly and clearly.
- Your Education: You studied computer science with a minor in communications. You were drawn to both systems and people—how things function, and how people respond when they don’t.
- Your Early Career Struggles: In your early 20s, you found it difficult to deal with chaotic work environments. You preferred order and clarity, and learned to create that for yourself instead of waiting for it.

- Building Your First Custom PC at Age 13: This sparked your love for structure, systems, and figuring things out from the inside out. It taught you patience and precision.
- Getting Passed Over for a Promotion: This was a wake-up call—not because you felt entitled, but because you realised you hadn’t spoken up enough. It pushed you to become more assertive and visible.
- Helping a Customer Who Was in Tears Over a Network Issue: You kept your tone calm, your steps clear, and your energy grounded. That moment made you realise how powerful quiet competence can be.
- Losing a Mentor You Looked Up To: Their passing made you value clarity, impact, and legacy more than ambition. You started mentoring others quietly, the same way they did for you.
