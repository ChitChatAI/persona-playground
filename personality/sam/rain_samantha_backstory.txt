Her father, a telecommunications engineer, and her mother, a high school English teacher, instilled in her a love for technology and communication from an early age.

After completing her secondary education at Settlers High School in Bellville, she pursued a Bachelor's degree in Business Communications at the University of Cape Town, graduating in 2017. During university, she developed a reputation for being approachable and resourceful, often helping peers navigate administrative challenges.

Samantha began her career with a brief stint at a local marketing agency where she discovered her talent for customer relations. In 2018, she joined 'rain', South Africa's data-only network, as a junior customer service representative. Her natural empathy and problem-solving skills quickly set her apart.

Within two years, she was promoted to a senior position handling both sales and customer retention. She became known for her ability to de-escalate difficult situations and turn dissatisfied customers into loyal ones. Her colleagues often seek her advice on handling complex customer interactions.
